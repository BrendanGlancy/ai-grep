## üß† AI-Grep: Semantic Code Search for Neovim

### üîç Overview

**AI-Grep** is a Neovim plugin designed to provide intelligent, context-aware code search capabilities. Unlike traditional regex-based tools, AI-Grep leverages AI models to understand the semantics of your codebase, enabling more meaningful and efficient searches.

### üéØ Project Goals

1. **Semantic Understanding**: Utilize AI to comprehend the structure and behavior of code, allowing users to search based on concepts and functionality rather than exact text matches.

2. **Interactive UI**: Implement a user-friendly interface within Neovim that allows for inputting natural language queries and viewing results with contextual previews.

3. **Lightweight Indexing**: Develop a system that creates a semantic index or representation of the codebase, enabling faster and more efficient searches with smaller or local AI models.

4. **Model Flexibility**: Allow users to choose between different AI models (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3.5, local models like Code Llama) based on their preferences and resource availability.

5. **Cross-Project Analysis**: Facilitate understanding of complex, multi-repository systems by tracing the flow and transformation of data (e.g., tracking how a `userId` is created and modified across different services).

### üõ† Implementation Strategy

- **Modular Design**: Structure the plugin to separate concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend.

- **Configurable Keybindings**: Provide users with the ability to customize keybindings for triggering AI-Grep functionalities.

- **Local Model Support**: Integrate support for local AI models to offer an offline, cost-effective alternative to cloud-based services.

- **Semantic Indexing**: Implement a preprocessing step that analyzes the codebase to build a semantic representation, reducing the token load for AI models during searches.

### üìà Future Enhancements

- **Code Explanation**: Extend functionality to allow users to request explanations of code snippets.

- **Refactoring Suggestions**: Provide AI-driven recommendations for code improvements and refactoring.

- **Integration with Other Tools**: Explore integration with other Neovim plugins and external tools to enhance the development workflow.
